# nanopore-reads-classification

Benchmark of Oxford Nanopore raw reads taxonomic classification using different approaches

## Rationale

Nanopore users have widely adopted the [WIMP (What's in my pot?)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/030742v1)
workflow for the taxonomic classification of whole metagenome experiments performed using the long-read single-molecule
sequences from Oxford Nanopore.

Here we evaluate the results of the pipeline with open source alternatives.
